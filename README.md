I'm Rohit. A software engineer recently graduated from Singapore Management University :) My current tech stack includes Java SpringBoot & Angular to help the company I work for develop a web application that promotes the harmonisation among medical institutions around Singapore. My goal is to help build meaningful applications for users, allowing them to live better, more convenient lives. I am committed to helping companies advance by assiting them in engineering applications to communicate the essence of their products to consumers. During my spare time, I like to read, hit the gym, watch shows and chill with my friends ðŸ˜€
